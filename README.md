# 2DCellularAutomaton
Compilation of several famous cellular automatons. The automatons are not coded generically  (key of rules) but are based on conditional algorithms.

## Automatons
- Game of life
- Rock paper scisors

## Limitations
The program is limited to :
- 2 dimensions automaton
- Rectangle shape cells
- Integer cells's state

## About the code
The program is splited in two parts: the user interface part, the algorithm and data part.
